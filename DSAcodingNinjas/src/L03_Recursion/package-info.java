/* BASIC STEPS OF RECURSION
 * 1. Divide the problem in two halves-
 * 	a) One that we'll small
 * 	b) One whose answer recursion will give us.
 * 	Example: {1, 23, 43, 15, 6, 75}
 *  We have to solve: {1} + {23, 43, 15, 6, 75}
 *  Answer from recursion: {23, 43, 15, 6, 75}
 *  
 * 2. Write base case
